Case II: Understanding from Numerical Control Driven Machining Control (milling,Lathe,Planner,etc.) .

Business case:
To analyze information collected by the numerical control and stored in high frequency to bring human understandable hints.

Needs:
To identify operation periods of the machine
Create a UI to facilitate the interaction
Determine when the machine is working
Determine timing and Energy demands per program name.
Determine Alerts and contextualize them (Type and Location)
Document the approach and Algorithms.
